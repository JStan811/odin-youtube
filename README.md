# odin-youtube

This is from Odin's HTML and CSS course - [Project: Embedding Images and Video](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video). The objective is to recreate YouTube's video player page, focusing on "embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side."
